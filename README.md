# DenseSharp (WIP)
3D Deep Learning from CT Scans Predicts Tumor Invasiveness of Subcentimeter Pulmonary Adenocarcinomas

DenseSharp Networks are 3D DenseNet-based deep neural networks with multi-task learning the nodule classification labels and segmentations. 

# Code Structure
* [`mylib/`](mylib/):
    * ...
* [`training.py`](training.py):
* [`preprocessing.py`](preprocessing.py):

# Requirements
* TensorFlow==1.4.0
* Keras==2.1.5

Higher versions should also work (maybe with minor modifications).
